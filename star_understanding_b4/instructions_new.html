        Repeated Instructions - Block 4
    </h3>

    <p>
        This is a repetition of the instructions you were shown on the previous page.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In this study, you are in a randomly formed group of {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants. 
        Your group members will not change across rounds or blocks. 
        Each participant in the group may choose one of three colors: green, purple, or yellow. Your
        payoff at the end of each round depends on the color you choose and the colors chosen by the 
        other participants.
    </p>
    <p>
        The way payoffs are calculated will never change within a block, but they may change from block to block.  
        At the start of each block, you will be told whether payoffs are calculated the same way as in the previous block or if conditions changed.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is Block #4 of six blocks of ten rounds each--a total of sixty rounds. 
        One of these rounds will be randomly chosen at the end 
        of the experiment to determine your payment.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this block of ten rounds, the maximum payoff you can earn in any round is 28 points. 1 point is equivalent to $0.1.

        The way payoffs are calculated is the same as the previous block.
    </p>

    <p>
        The diagram below portrays the information flow between
        the {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants. You 
        {% if player.id_in_group == 1 %}
            (Player Q)
        {% elif player.id_in_group == 2 %}
            (Player R)
        {% elif player.id_in_group == 3 %}
            (Player T)
        {% elif player.id_in_group == 4 %}
            (Player S)
        {% else %}
            ERROR
        {% endif %}
        will only see the colors chosen by the participants who are 
        connected to you by a line in the displayed diagram (
        {% if player.id_in_group == 1 %}
            (Player R)
        {% elif player.id_in_group == 2 %}
            (Player Q and Player T)
        {% elif player.id_in_group == 3 %}
            (Player R and Player S)
        {% elif player.id_in_group == 4 %}
            (Player T)
        {% else %}
            ERROR
        {% endif %}
        ).
        You will know only your own payoff, not the payoffs of any other participants.

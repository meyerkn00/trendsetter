# Trendsetter Project

## Overview
Participants coordinate with three others (groups of 4) to solve a graph coloring problem.
- This means each round they select a color and get a payoff based on their selection and the decisions of others.
- The idea is they have to figure out how to coordinate on the best color.

There are four types of networks. Complete, circle, star, and line. Each network has a different level of visibility, meaning that participants can only see the decisions of a different number of group members.


There are 6 blocks of 10 rounds. 

In the first block, participants are led to select green, which results in a payoff of 12. All other selectios result in a payoff of 0.

In the second block, the participants are given the opportunity to earn more than 12. This is the key part of the experiment: *they are induced into a suboptimal equilibrium and then given the opportunity to get to the optimal equilibrium*

### Dependencies

**See requirements.txt**

- OTree
- Python 3.11.2
	- Use Anaconda for dependency management

### Deployment Instructions

- Install Anaconda for dependency management
- Install oTree
- Create environment.yml file
	- name: trend
	- dependencies:
		- python=3.11.2
- Activate environment with common: conda activate trend
- Edit the code as you wish.
- Test code with otree devserver
- When ready call otree zip to zip the files.
- Upload to Otreehub in the trendsetters project.
	- *Note to self, where does Heroku come into play?*
	- *Second note, this could also be deployed from Github, but I assume that process is more complicated*
- Reset the database
- Youâ€™ll have to regenerate the links if you reset the database
